## Chain Syncer

Chain syncer keeps you in sync with arbitrary blockchain if you implement the [api](src/api.rs).

Chain tip is "eventually consistent" with the settlement layer through eager fork competition such that 
superseded forks are immediately deleted from DB and replaced with more valuable fork when it appears.
Ie. only one winning fork is kept in the DB at given moment. This allows for much better performance and space efficiency.

### Usage

```
chain-syncer = { git = "https://github.com/pragmaxim-com/chain-syncer" }
```
